You can definitely say that culture makes a change in the role of a graphic designer. Next to that, culture also change the taste and the actual way of designing. I noticed this even more while I did my internship in Zanzibar (Tanzania). The most comment reason I can give for this is the far developed technology in the western culture. The “World Wide Web” gives us access to a big amount of information and let us share and see (almost) everything. The Internet has made the books and actual print fade into the background. Instead of the print, the new media has taken over. With new media I mean, among other things, websites, applications and interactive media. It makes us more curious and changed the way we see graphic design. Not only the visual side of graphic design but also the conceptual way of thinking. Our esthetic preferences are influenced by all the of images, movies, advertisements, texts and colors which we see in (short) time. We became more critical if we talk about our interests. We ‘scroll’ to our lives and only stop and pay attention when something really catch our eye. This has made the actual design change. Nowadays our data is being checked and studied. Based on our age, interests and recent search terms advertisements and articles are displayed, which you might be interested in. Individual profiles are created and we’re able to divide target groups really clear. By showing specific articles which you probably going to click and read, we lose track (so now and then) how many time we spend on the internet. Unconsciously we swipe and we forget for a moment the rest of the world around us. We are in an a-just-slightly-better-representation-than-the-real-world for a moment.</br></br>

We all know, after a serie of selfies, we will pick the most beautiful one, we apply a filter on top of it which makes all the small imperfections a bit less. We see all the beautiful bodies, cars and interiors passing by, which we all would love to have. The desire and the pursuit of a perfect life makes our society the so-called meritocracy. This society forces us to be better and more progressive. Parents both have a job, children must be in a club, should be busy and full of other appointments. Graphically, this means that we are always concerned with innovation, improvement and change.</br></br>

In contrast, my time in Africa, was a relief. This had partly to do with the technology, that is not yet<a href="#fn1" name="fr1"><sup>1</sup></a> playing a major role. Surrounded by Tanzanian traditions and habits I realized that a world full of technology does not always make happier. The saying “quality time” what I often hear in the Western culture, is not appointed in Tanzania but applied. You see lots of families living under one roof. They take time to cook together and do the housework. The large amount of traditions ensures that old rituals are relived. Ancient rituals are associated with different visual expressions. Think of special costumes that are worn, but also the way how certain prayers are beign performed. This clearly reflects the way of designing. Also the large amount of work that is analogous developed, and the visual way of design. The bright colors that shows emotions and and the many prints of the nature.</br></br>

In the future we will see if the technology, which is slowly going to be applied in Africa, is going to make much difference. I am very curious about the change that Africa will be going through the upcoming years. Will after full connection of the network, also the graphic designers make more conceptual work? Will traditions and the care for each other become less important? I hope not.</b>
